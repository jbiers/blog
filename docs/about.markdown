Welcome to my little space in the Web. My goal with this blog is to share my journey in learning and improving as a Software Engineer.

I started my career in early 2022 as the usual CRUD developer. As time went on, I found myself going down the software stack and finding my place in developing infrastructure solutions. I currently work at SUSE on the Rancher project.

With this blog, I hope to track my progress as an engineer in the upcoming years. My interests lie mostly in the Cloud-Native and Linux ecosystems, encompassing operating systems, networking, distributed systems and more.
